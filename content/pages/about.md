## Code

I'm a Seattle-based full-stack software engineer who loves rigorous exception handling, efficient concurrent code, and fries with mayonnaise.

*Sometimes I hike stuff.*

Have a look at some of my projects and posts.

## Music

I play bass with [The Driftwood Walkers](https://thedriftwoodwalkers.com/).

Sometimes I make music and put it on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jonathan-mellman) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoKNvLs9j6VBtKww7OsZ_rA/).

I keep a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1242727868/playlist/74JYIKcLYVjm5oW2tMXNSH?si=lJQYbfEXTbqyjkl9k77gyw) of all the songs I've ever Shazaamed (from least to most recent).
