I'm a staff software engineer based in Seattle, Washington. I love rigorous exception handling, efficient concurrency, and fries with mayonnaise.

_Sometimes I hike stuff._

## Code

I love TypeScript, Node.js, React, Docker, and cloud services, with a 60/40 frontend-backend split.

Have a look at some of my projects and posts, or check out my [resume](/media/JonMellman_Resume.pdf).

## Music

Sometimes I make music and put it on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jonathan-mellman) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoKNvLs9j6VBtKww7OsZ_rA/).

I played bass with [The Driftwood Walkers](https://thedriftwoodwalkers.com/).

I keep a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1242727868/playlist/74JYIKcLYVjm5oW2tMXNSH?si=lJQYbfEXTbqyjkl9k77gyw) of all the songs I've ever Shazaamed (from least to most recent).
