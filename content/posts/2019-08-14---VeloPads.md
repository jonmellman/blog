Last Wednesday, my friend Micah and I had a friend-hackathon where we worked together to create paper-thin and velocity-sensitive drum pad MIDI controllers. LINK TO HACKATHON POST

<!-- video of velopad -->

It was a fun process, and it was gratifying to end the day with something that actually _worked_. I'll explain how to build your own in this post.

## Materials:
* Arduino Micro - $?
* Velostat Sheet - $?
* Conductive Nylon - $?
* Resistor, Breadboard, Wires, ?? Ohm Resistor - $?

## References
* [Arduino code](TODO)
* [Circuit diagram](TODO)
* To convert the MIDI signal into audio, you'll need to install a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). For a free option, consider [Reaper](TODO) which was designed by the creator of old WinAmp TODO.

### Arduino Micro

Arduino Micro is a tiny microcontroller. We found that we couldn't use an Arduino Uno, because it can't be recognized as a MIDI device. The Arduino Micro can though. And it's cheap!

### Velostat

Velostat is the hero here. It comes in film-like sheets that can be easily cut and folded. When introduced into a closed circuit in place of wire or other conductor, it acts as a dynamic resistor _whose resistance decreases as more pressure is applied_. From that description, it should be clear that it can act as a pressure sensor.

There are plenty of resources on Velostat online. TODO examples

### Conductive Nylon

We really could have used any conductor here. This particular conductive nylon is nice because it has conductive adhesive on one side, making it quite easy to work with.

### Misc Electronics

There's nothing special about any of these. Most DIY packs should include what we need.

<!-- 	Why do a hackathon?
		Free time and energy
		Interest in electronics / arduino
		Interest in music
	How to do it?
		Set a date (it's the most important part)
		Come prepared
			Do any prior research so you're not spending together time setting up
			Bring good vibes. This might be preparing coffee and bagels.
		Start with an unstructured brainstorm, talk about what you're interested in and see where interests align.
		Keep it realistic:
			"It would be cool to make fingerpad"
			"Yeah I'm on board!"
			"It would be awesome to make a self-contained fingerpad with its own audio out"
			"That's out of scope"
		Plan your tasks and put them somewhere shared. We had two people, so a simple google doc worked fine. We were going to be pairing on most tasks, rather than divvying up the work.

I like software. Iteration speed, revision history, cheap duplication (vs velopads) -->
